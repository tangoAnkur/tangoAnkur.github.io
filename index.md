👤 About Me
I’m Ankur Das, currently working as a Senior Data Engineer at Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (since May 2023). I specialize in building scalable, end-to-end data solutions that enable innovation in data extraction, transformation, and insight generation.

With over 7 years of experience in global data engineering, I have led and collaborated with cross-functional teams to manage and process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale. My technical expertise includes open-source technologies such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, Hive, and HDFS for Big Data processing, as well as Python and Power BI for data visualization and storytelling.

I’m passionate about the foundational aspects of data engineering — often referring to myself as a “data plumber” who ensures the seamless flow and reliability of data pipelines across complex systems.

Driven by a mindset of lifelong learning and design-oriented development, I approach every challenge with a problem-solving attitude, always prioritizing globally scalable, customer-centric product delivery.

Prior to joining Mercedes-Benz, I contributed to data platform transformation projects across diverse industries at HSBC, Collabera, Ford Motors, and Altimetrik.
